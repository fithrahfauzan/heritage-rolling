# Heritage Land Distribution

A fullstack web app for fairly distributing land documents among members via a
"spin the wheel" draw. Each spin decides the recipient live (respecting fair
per-class quotas); pinned documents are awarded automatically up front.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# requires Node ≥ 20.19 or ≥ 22.12 (Vite 7 constraint)
make install
make dev          # → http://localhost:3000
```

Default password: **`heritage`** — change it before any public deployment
(see [Configuration](#configuration)).

---

## How it works

Documents are classified as **top**, **middle**, or **bottom** and distributed
in that order:

| Class  | Rule                                                                                                    |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| top    | Even split. Supports `preassignedTo` — pin a document to a specific member (counts toward their quota). |
| middle | Even split. Count must be divisible by member count.                                                    |
| bottom | Floor per member, leftover documents assigned randomly to distinct members.                             |

A run goes through the states `empty → draft → in_progress → committed`.
Committed runs can be rerun — the previous result is archived.

## Configuration

All config lives in `config/` and is read at runtime (no rebuild needed):

```
config/
  members.json          ← member list  [{ "id", "name" }]
  branding.json         ← brand strings (logo, name, title, tagline)
  assets/
    top.json            ← top documents (add "preassignedTo": "<memberId>" to pin)
    middle.json         ← middle documents
    bottom.json         ← bottom documents
```

Customise the brand without touching code by editing `config/branding.json`:

```json
{
    "logoText": "HL",
    "brandName": "Heritage Land",
    "title": "Land Distribution",
    "tagline": "Distribution System"
}
```

Each asset file is an array of objects without the `classification` field (it is
implied by the filename):

```json
[
    {
        "certificateNumber": "SHM-0001",
        "name": "Soekarno",
        "location": "Jl. Merdeka No. 8, Jakarta",
        "area": 537,
        "preassignedTo": "m1"
    }
]
```

**Environment variables** (set in `.env` or `docker-compose.yml`):

| Variable         | Default                                           | Notes                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `APP_PASSWORD`   | `heritage`                                        | Change in production       |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | `dev-only-insecure-session-secret-change-me-0001` | Must be ≥ 32 chars in prod |
| `PORT`           | `3000`                                            |                            |

## Development

```bash
make dev            # dev server with HMR
make test           # run tests once
make test-watch     # watch mode
make typecheck      # tsc --noEmit
make format         # Prettier write
make format-check   # Prettier check (used in CI)
```

---

## Production build

```bash
make build          # outputs dist/client + dist/server/server.js
make start          # build + serve with srvx
```

---

## Docker deployment

```bash
make docker-rebuild   # build image + start container on :3000
make docker-logs      # tail logs
make docker-down      # stop
```

The compose file:

- Bind-mounts `config/` read-only — edit documents without rebuilding the image.
- Persists `data/` (distribution state) as a named volume across restarts.
- Includes a health check on `/login`.

Override credentials at deploy time:

```bash
APP_PASSWORD=secret SESSION_SECRET=your-32-char-secret docker compose up -d --build
```

| `/`           | Dashboard — status, member/document counts                                               |
| `/distribute` | Spin wheel (recipient decided per spin), member-per-row board, pinned auto-placed, rerun |
| `/report`     | Full report per member with bulk PDF export                                              |
| `/debug`      | Allocation debug view (not linked from nav; accessible by URL)                           |
